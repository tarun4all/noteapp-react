The suffix [[-ism]] denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy.{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} The word anarchism appears in English from 1642{{sfn|Definition of Anarchism by Merriam-Webster|2019}} as ''anarchisme''<ref>{{cite OED|anarchism}}</ref> and the word ''anarchy'' from 1539.<ref>{{cite OED|anarchy}}</ref> Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as anarchists, although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}\n\nThe first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} the term [[libertarianism]] has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|Guerin|1970|loc=The Basic Ideas of Anarchism}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1= Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to [[Individualist anarchism|individualistic free-market philosophy]] only, referring to [[free-market anarchism]] as libertarian anarchism.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}\n\nWhile [[Anti-statism|opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of talk among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p= 217}} Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organization]] (including the [[State (polity)|state]], [[Anarchism and capitalism| capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism| nationalism]] and all associated [[institution]]s) in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[voluntary association]], on [[freedom]] and on [[decentralisation]], but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an ''a posteriori'' conclusion).{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}} Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following:{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}\n# The will for a non-coercive society.\n# The rejection of the state apparatus.\n# The belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society.\n# A suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of [[anarchy]].\n\n","attributes":[{"name":"main","values":[{"name":"1","value":"Definition of anarchism"}]},{"name":"see also","values":[{"name":"1","value":"Anarchist terminology"}]},{"name":"sfnm","values":[{"name":"1a1","value":"Bates"},{"name":"1y","value":"2017"},{"name":"1p","value":"128"},{"name":"2a1","value":"Long"},{"name":"2y","value":"2013"},{"name":"2p","value":"217"}]},{"name":"sfn","values":[{"name":"1","value":"Definition of Anarchism by Merriam-Webster"},{"name":"2","value":"2019"}]},{"name":"cite OED","values":[{"name":"1","value":"anarchism"}]},{"name":"cite OED","values":[{"name":"1","value":"anarchy"}]},{"name":"sfn","values":[{"name":"1","value":"Joll"},{"name":"2","value":"1964"},{"name":"pp","value":"27–37"}]},{"name":"lang-fr","values":[{"name":"1","value":"anarchiste"}]},{"name":"sfn","values":[{"name":"1","value":"Nettlau"},{"name":"2","value":"1996"},{"name":"p","value":"162"}]},{"name":"sfn","values":[{"name":"1","value":"Guerin"},{"name":"2","value":"1970"},{"name":"loc","value":"The Basic Ideas of Anarchism"}]},{"name":"sfnm","values":[{"name":"1a1","value":"Ward"},{"name":"1y","value":"2004"},{"name":"1p","value":"62"},{"name":"2a1","value":"Goodway"},{"name":"2y","value":"2006"},{"name":"2p","value":"4"},{"name":"3a1","value":"Skirda"},{"name":"3y","value":"2002"},{"name":"3p","value":"183"},{"name":"4a1","value":"Fernández"},{"name":"4y","value":"2009"},{"name":"4p","value":"9"}]},{"name":"sfn","values":[{"name":"1","value":"Morris"},{"name":"2","value":"2002"},{"name":"p","value":"61"}]},{"name":"sfn","values":[{"name":"1","value":"Long"},{"name":"2","value":"2013"},{"name":"p","value":"217"}]},{"name":"sfnm","values":[{"name":"1a1","value":"McLaughlin"},{"name":"1y","value":"2007"},{"name":"1pp","value":"25–29"},{"name":"2a1","value":"Long"},{"name":"2y","value":"2013"},{"name":"2pp","value":"217"}]},{"name":"sfn","values":[{"name":"1","value":"McLaughlin"},{"name":"2","value":"2007"},{"name":"pp","value":"25–26"}]}],"id":1},{"title":" History ","paragraphs":"{{main|History of anarchism}}\n\n=== Pre-modern era ===\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BC), whose ''[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'' inspired [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]\nDuring the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=xi–xiv}} Most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in [[History of China|China]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]] was delineated by [[Taoism|Taoist philosophers]] [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] and [[Lao Tzu]].{{sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}} Likewise in Greece, anarchic attitudes were articulated by tragedians and philosophers. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and [[autonomy|personal autonomy]]. [[Socrates]] questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (''nomos'') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (''physis''). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the Islamic world or in Christian Europe. This kind of tradition later gave birth to [[religious anarchism]]. In Persia, [[Mazdak]] called for an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian society]] and the [[abolition of monarchy]], only to be soon executed by the king.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}} In [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Libertarian ideas further emerged during the [[Renaissance]] with the spread of [[Rationalism|reasoning]] and [[humanism]] through Europe. Novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress.{{sfn|Adams|2014|p=33-63}}\n\n=== Modern era ===\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], the partisan groups of [[Enragés]] and {{lang|fr|[[sans-culottes]]}} saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=4}} The first anarchist currents developed thoughout the 18th century—[[William Godwin]] espoused [[philosophical anarchism]] in England, morally delegitimizing the state, [[Max Stirner]]'s thinking paved the way to individualism, and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s theory of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] found fertile soil in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}} This era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the Spanish Civil War of 1936 and is considered the golden age of anarchism. {{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}}\n\n[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|upright|Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed the [[Marxism|Marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and allied himself with the federalists in the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]] before his expulsion by the Marxists]]\nDrawing from mutualism, [[Mikhail Bakunin]] founded [[collectivist anarchism]] and entered the [[International Workingmen's Association]], a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, and [[Karl Marx]] a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin's faction, the [[Jura Federation]] and Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marxist [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{sfnm|1a1=Dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=Thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=Chaliand|3a2=Blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} After bitter disputes the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the Marxists at the [[1872 Hague Congress]].{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1y=2019|1pp=334–336|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marxist's terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. After being expelled, anarchists formed the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier International]]. Under the influence of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped with collectivism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=5}} Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], advocated for free federation and distribution of goods according to one's needs.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=xii}}\n\nAt the turning of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world.{{sfn|Moya|2015|p=327}} In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=519–521}} Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, pouring into the Japanese capital to study.{{sfnm|1a1=Dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=Ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681–682}} In [[Latin America]], [[Anarchism in Argentina|São Paulo]] was a stronghold for anarcho-syndicalism where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=Laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504–508}} During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary [[political violence]]. This strategy became known as [[propaganda of the deed]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many [[Communards]] to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{sfn|Anderson|2004}} Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} [[Illegalism]] was another strategy which some anarchists adopted these same years.{{sfn|Bantman|2019|p=374}}\n\n[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]\nAnarchists enthusiastically participated in the [[Russian Revolution]]—despite concerns—in opposition to the [[White movement|Whites]]. However, they met harsh suppression after the [[Bolshevik government]] was stabilized. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine,{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} notably leading to the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and [[Nestor Makhno]]'s struggle in the [[Free Territory]]. With the anarchists being crushed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for the revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. Seeing the victories of the Bolsheviks in the [[October Revolution]] and the resulting [[Russian Civil War]], many workers and activists turned to [[Communist party|communist parties]] which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements, the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World]], left their organisations and joined the [[Communist International]].{{sfn|Nomad|1966|p=88}}\n\nIn the [[Spanish Civil War]], anarchists and syndicalists ([[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of [[Spanish anarchism]] led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivised]] the land.{{sfn|Bolloten|1984|p=1107}} The Soviet Union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named [[May Days]] as [[Joseph Stalin]] tried to seize control of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 466}}\n\n=== Post-war era ===\n[[File:Rojava Sewing Cooperative.jpg|thumb|[[Rojava]] is supporting efforts for workers to form cooperatives, such as this sewing cooperative]]\nAt the end of World War II, the anarchist movement was severely weakened.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=xi}} However, the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and tensions built by the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=539}} During this time, anarchism took root in other movements critical to both the state and capitalism such as the [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]] and [[Peace movement|pacifist movements]], the [[New Left]], and the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi & 539}} Anarchism became associated with [[punk subculture]] as exemplified by bands such as [[Crass]] and the [[Sex Pistols]],{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=493–494}} and the established [[feminist]] tendencies of [[anarcha-feminism]] returned with vigour during the [[second wave of feminism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=556–557}}\n\nAround the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within [[anti-war]], [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the [[World Trade Organization]], [[Group of Eight]] and [[World Economic Forum]]. During the protests, ''ad hoc'' leaderless anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s engaged in [[riot]]ing, [[property destruction]] and violent confrontations with the [[police]]. Other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity group]]s and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] in Mexico, and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as [[Rojava]], a ''de facto'' [[Permanent

Territory''', formerly known as the '''Federal Capital Territory''' until 1938 and commonly referred to as the '''ACT''', is a [[federal territory]] of [[Australia]] containing the Australian capital city of [[Canberra]] and some surrounding [[township#Australia|township]]s. It is located in the south-east of the country and is an [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] within the state of [[New South Wales]]. Founded after [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] as the seat of government for the new nation, all important institutions of the [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] are centred in the territory.\n\nOn 1 January 1901, [[Federation of Australia|federation of the colonies]] of Australia was achieved. Section 125 of the new [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provided that land, situated in New South Wales and at least {{convert|100|miles|km|abbr=}} from [[Sydney]], would be ceded to the new [[Government of Australia|federal government]]. Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales, the ''[[Seat of Government Act 1908]]'' was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region. The territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by [[New South Wales]] in 1911, two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913.\n\nWhile the overwhelming majority of the population reside in the city of [[Canberra]] in the ACT's north-east, the territory also includes some surrounding townships such as [[Williamsdale, Australian Capital Territory|Williamsdale]], [[Naas (valley)|Naas]], [[Uriarra, Australian Capital Territory|Uriarra]], [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]] and [[Hall, Australian Capital Territory|Hall]]. The ACT also includes the [[Namadgi National Park]] which comprises the majority of land area of the territory. Despite a common misconception, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] is not part of the ACT although the laws of the Australian Capital Territory apply as if Jervis Bay did form part of the ACT.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx|title=Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration|website=Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> The territory has a relatively dry, continental climate experiencing warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters.\n\nThe Australian Capital Territory is home to many important institutions of the federal government, national monuments and museums. This includes the [[Parliament of Australia]], the [[High Court of Australia]], the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] and the [[Australian War Memorial]]. It also hosts the majority of foreign embassies in Australia as well as regional headquarters of many international organisations, not-for-profit groups, lobbying groups and professional associations. Several major universities also have campuses in the ACT including the [[Australian National University]], the [[University of Canberra]], the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Charles Sturt University]] and the [[Australian Catholic University]].\n\nA locally elected legislative assembly has governed the territory since 1988. However, the Commonwealth maintains authority over the territory and may overturn local laws. It still maintains control over the area known as the [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]] through the [[National Capital Authority]]. Residents of the territory elect three members to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and two Senators to the [[Australian Senate]].\n\nWith 423,800 residents, the Australian Capital Territory is the second smallest mainland state or territory by population. At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, the median weekly income for people in the territory aged over 15 was $998 and higher than the national average of $662.<ref name=\"census\" /> The average level of degree qualification in the ACT is also higher than the national average. Within the ACT, 37.1% of the population hold a bachelor's degree level or above education compared to the national figure of 20%.<ref name=\"census\" />\n\n","attributes":[{"name":"short

Australian Capital Territory}}\nThe environments range from [[Alpine climate|alpine]] area on the higher mountains, to [[sclerophyll]] forest and to [[woodland]]. Much of the ACT has been cleared for grazing and is also burnt off by [[bushfire]]s several times per century. The kinds of plants can be grouped into [[vascular plants]], that include [[gymnosperm]]s, flowering plants, and [[fern]]s, as well as [[bryophyte]]s, [[lichen]]s, [[fungi]] and freshwater [[algae]]. Four flowering plants are endemic to the ACT. Several lichens are unique to the territory. Most plants in the ACT are characteristic of the [[Australian flora|Flora of Australia]] and include well known plants such as [[Grevillea]], [[Eucalyptus]] trees and [[kangaroo grass]].\n\nThe native forest in the Canberra region was almost wholly [[Eucalyptus|eucalypt]] species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf|title=Inquiry into the Operational Response to the January 2003 Bushfires in the ACT|last=McLeod|first=Ron|year=2003|isbn=0-642-60216-6|location=Canberra, ACT|ref=harv|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514031921/http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf|archivedate=14 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe fauna of the territory includes representatives from most major [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animal groups]]. This includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, platypus, echidna, emu, kookaburras and dragon lizards.\n\n===Geology===\n{{main|Geology of the Australian Capital Territory}}\nNotable geological formations in the Australian Capital Territory include the ''Canberra Formation'', the ''Pittman Formation'', ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' and ''State Circle Shale''.\n\nIn the 1840s [[fossil]]s of [[brachiopod]]s and [[trilobite]]s from the [[Silurian]] period were discovered at Woolshed Creek near [[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]]. At the time, these were the oldest fossils discovered in Australia, though this record has now been far surpassed.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.environment.act.gov.au/Files/heritageregister20010.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051022162853/http://www.environment.act.gov.au/Files/heritageregister20010.pdf|archivedate=22 October 2005|publisher=ACT Heritage Council|title=Entry to the ACT Heritage Register – 20010.

During this period the region along with most of Eastern Australia was part of the ocean floor; formations from this period include the ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' formation and the ''Pittman Formation'' consisting largely of [[quartz]]-rich [[sandstone]], [[siltstone]] and [[shale]]. These formations became exposed when the ocean floor was raised by a major [[orogeny|volcanic activity]] in the [[Devonian]] forming much of the east coast of Australia.\n\n","attributes":[{"name":"convert","values":[{"name":"1","value":"2280"},{"name":"2","value":"km2"},{"name":"3","value":"mi2"}]},{"name":"convert","values":[{"name":"1","value":"88.5"},{"name":"2","value":"km"},{"name":"3","value":"mi"}]},{"name":"convert","values":[{"name":"1","value":"57.75"},{"name":"2","value":"km"},{"name":"3","value":"mi"}]},{"name":"Cite

climate|alpine]] area on the higher mountains, to [[sclerophyll]] forest and to [[woodland]]. Much of the ACT has been cleared for grazing and is also burnt off by [[bushfire]]s several times per century. The kinds of plants can be grouped into [[vascular plants]], that include [[gymnosperm]]s, flowering plants, and [[fern]]s, as well as [[bryophyte]]s, [[lichen]]s, [[fungi]] and freshwater [[algae]]. Four flowering plants are endemic to the ACT. Several lichens are unique to the territory. Most plants in the ACT are characteristic of the [[Australian flora|Flora of Australia]] and include well known plants such as [[Grevillea]], [[Eucalyptus]] trees and [[kangaroo grass]].\n\nThe native forest in the Canberra region was almost wholly [[Eucalyptus|eucalypt]] species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf|title=Inquiry into the Operational Response to the January 2003 Bushfires in the ACT|last=McLeod|first=Ron|year=2003|isbn=0-642-60216-6|location=Canberra, ACT|ref=harv|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514031921/http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf|archivedate=14 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe fauna of the territory includes representatives from most major [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animal groups]].

Shorto]]'s ''Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary''. Little work has been done on the [[Munda languages]], which are not well documented. With their demotion from a primary branch, Proto-Mon–Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic.\n\nPaul Sidwell (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon–Khmer as follows:\n\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\"\n|-\n| *p || *t || *c || *k || *ʔ\n|-\n| *b || *d || *ɟ || *ɡ ||\n|-\n| *ɓ || *ɗ || *ʄ || ||\n|-\n| *m || *n || *ɲ || *ŋ ||\n|-\n| *w || *l, *r || *j || ||\n|-\n| || *s || || || *h\n|}\n\nThis is identical to earlier reconstructions except for {{IPA|*ʄ}}.  {{IPA|*ʄ}} is better preserved in the [[Katuic languages]], which Sidwell has specialized in. Sidwell (2011) suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is the middle [[Mekong]], in the area of the Bahnaric and Katuic languages (approximately where modern Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia come together), and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed, dating to perhaps 2000 BCE.<ref name=\"SidwellBlench2011\" />\n\nPeiros (2011) criticized Sidwell's theory heavily and calls it a bunch of contradictions. He show with his analysis that the homeland of Austroasiatic is somewhere near the [[Yangtze]]. He suggests the [[Sichuan Basin]] as likely homeland of proto-Austroasiatic before they migrated to other parts of central and southern China and than into Southeast Asia. He further suggests that the family must be as old as proto-Austronesian and proto-Sinotibetan or even older.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jolr.ru/files/(68)jlr2011-6(101-114).pdf|title=Some thoughts on the problem of the Austro-Asiatic homeland|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Peiros (2011)|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nGeorg van Driem (2011) proposes that the homeland of Austroasiatic is somewhere in southern China. He suggests that the region around the [[Pearl River (China)]] is the likely homeland of the Austroasiatic languages and people. He further suggests, based on genetic studies, that the migration of [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]] people from Taiwan replaced the original Austroasiatic language but the effect on the people was only minor. Local Austroasiatic speakers adopted Kra-Dai languages and partially their culture.<ref>[[George van Driem|van Driem, George]]. (2011). Rice and the Austroasiatic and Hmong-Mien homelands. In N. J.

Sidwell & [[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node, which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic.<ref name=\"SidwellBlench2011\">Sidwell, Paul, and Roger Blench. 2011. \"[http://rogerblench.info/Archaeology/SE%20Asia/SR09/Sidwell%20Blench%20offprint.pdf The Austroasiatic Urheimat: the Southeastern Riverine Hypothesis].\" Enfield, NJ (ed.)

Austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] watershed of [[Lingnan]], which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of Vietnam, or downstream through the [[Mekong River]] via [[Yunnan]].<ref name=\"Sidwell2015\"/> Both the reconstructed lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early Austroasiatic speakers around 4,000 B.P. cultivated rice and [[millet]], kept livestock such as dogs, pigs, and chickens, and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments.<ref name=\"Sidwell2015\"/>\n\nAt 4,500 B.P., this \"Neolithic package\" suddenly arrived in Indochina from the Lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer cultures, with grain husks found in northern Indochina by 4,100 B.P. and in southern Indochina by 3,800 B.P.<ref name=\"Sidwell2015\"/> However, Sidwell (2015c) found that iron is not reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic, since each Austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from Tai, Chinese, Tibetan, Malay, and other languages.\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]] about 2,500 B.P., relatively young Austroasiatic branches in Indochina such as [[Vietic languages|Vietic]], [[Katuic languages|Katuic]], [[Pearic languages|Pearic]], and [[Khmer language|Khmer]] were formed, while the more internally diverse [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] branch (dating to about 3,000 B.P.) underwent more extensive internal diversification.<ref name=\"Sidwell2015\"/> By the Iron Age, all of the Austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present-day locations, with most of the diversification within Austroasiatic taking place during the Iron Age.<ref name=\"Sidwell2015\"/>\n\nPaul Sidwell (2018)<ref>Sidwell, Paul. 2018. ''Austroasiatic deep chronology and the problem of cultural lexicon''. Paper presented at the 28th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society, held 17–19 May 2018 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.</ref> considers the Austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years B.P. during the arrival of rice agriculture in Indochina, but notes that the origin of Proto-Austroasiatic itself is older than that date. The lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum. The early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts, animal names, natural features, and pronouns, while the names of cultural items (agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts, which are reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic) form part of the later stratum.\n\n[[Roger Blench]] (2017)<ref name=\"Blench2017\">Blench, Roger. 2017. ''[http://southasiabibliography.de/uploads/Blench.pdf Waterworld: lexical evidence for aquatic subsistence strategies in Austroasiatic]''. Presented at ICAAL 7, Kiel, Germany.</ref> suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies (such as boats, waterways, river fauna, and fish capture techniques), can be reconstructed for Proto-Austroasiatic. Blench (2017) finds widespread Austroasiatic roots for 'river, valley', 'boat', 'fish', 'catfish sp.', 'eel', 'prawn', 'shrimp' (Central Austroasiatic), 'crab', 'tortoise', 'turtle', 'otter', 'crocodile', 'heron, fishing bird', and 'fish trap'. Archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern [[Indochina]] (northern Vietnam, Laos, and other nearby areas) dates back to only about 4,000 years B.P. (2,000 B.C.), with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the Yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6,000 B.P.<ref name=\"Blench2017\"/>\n\nHence, this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of Austroasiatic as compared to [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], whose speakers had a distinct non-riverine culture. In addition to living an aquatic-based lifestyle, early Austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock, crops, and newer types of watercraft. As early Austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways, they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area, such as Sino-Tibetan.<ref name=\"Blench2017\"/>\n\n=== Possible extinct branches ===\n[[Roger Blench]] (2009)<ref>Blench, Roger. 2009. \"[http://icaal.org/abstract/blench-are.html Are there four additional unrecognised branches of Austroasiatic?].\"</ref> also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of Austroasiatic that are now extinct, based on [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrate]] evidence in modern-day languages.\n* '''Pre-[[Chamic language|Chamic]] languages''' (the languages of coastal Vietnam prior to the Chamic migrations).

did find an area of increased contact between the Bahnaric and Katuic languages, such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant [[Munda languages|Munda]] and Nicobarese show greater similarity to Bahnaric and Katuic the closer they are to those branches, without any noticeable innovations common to Bahnaric and Katuic.\n\nHe therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence. Sidwell & [[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi–Palaungic node, which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic.<ref name=\"SidwellBlench2011\">Sidwell, Paul, and Roger Blench. 2011. \"[http://rogerblench.info/Archaeology/SE%20Asia/SR09/Sidwell%20Blench%20offprint.pdf The Austroasiatic Urheimat: the Southeastern Riverine Hypothesis].\" Enfield, NJ (ed.)

Sidwell & Blench (2011) suggest [[Shompen language|Shompen]] as an additional branch, and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating. In general, however, the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed, since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central [[Mekong]] river valley relatively quickly.\n\n{{clade\n| label1=Austroasiatic: {{nobreak|Mon–Khmer}}\n| 1={{clade\n| 1=[[Munda languages|Munda]]\n| label2=&nbsp;Khasi–Palaungic&nbsp;\n| 2={{clade\n| 1=[[Khasic languages|Khasian]]\n| 2=[[Palaungic languages|Palaungic]]\n}}\n| 3=[[Khmuic languages|Khmuic]]\n| 4=[[Mangic languages|Mangic]]\n| 6=[[Vietic languages|Vietic]]\n| 7=[[Katuic languages|Katuic]]\n| 8=[[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]]\n| 9=[[Khmer language|Khmer]]\n| 10=[[Pearic languages|Pearic]]\n| 11=[[Monic languages|Monic]]\n| 12=[[Aslian languages|Aslian]]\n| 13=[[Nicobarese languages|Nicobarese]]\n| 14=?[[Shompen language|Shompen]]\n}}\n}}\n\nSubsequently, Sidwell (2015a: 179)<ref>Sidwell, Paul. 2015a. \"Austroasiatic classification.\" In Jenny, Mathias and Paul Sidwell, eds (2015).

Paper presented at the workshop ''Integrating inferences about our past: new findings and current issues in the peopling of the Pacific and South East Asia'', 22 – 23 June 2015, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Jena, Germany.</ref> further expanded his Mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that Austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into [[Indochina]] from the [[Lingnan]] area of [[southern China]], with the subsequent Mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of Neolithic farmers from southern China.\n\nSidwell (2015c) tentatively suggests that Austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5,000 years B.P. during the [[Neolithic transition]] era of [[mainland Southeast Asia]], with all the major branches of Austroasiatic formed by 4,000 B.P. Austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] watershed of [[Lingnan]], which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of Vietnam, or downstream through the [[Mekong River]] via [[Yunnan]].<ref name=\"Sidwell2015\"/> Both the reconstructed lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early Austroasiatic speakers around 4,000 B.P. cultivated rice and [[millet]], kept livestock such as dogs, pigs, and chickens, and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments.<ref name=\"Sidwell2015\"/>\n\nAt 4,500 B.P., this \"Neolithic package\" suddenly arrived in Indochina from the Lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer cultures, with grain husks found in northern Indochina by 4,100 B.P. and in southern Indochina by 3,800 B.P.<ref name=\"Sidwell2015\"/> However, Sidwell (2015c) found that iron is not reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic, since each Austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from Tai, Chinese, Tibetan, Malay, and other languages.\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]] about 2,500 B.P., relatively young Austroasiatic branches in Indochina such as [[Vietic languages|Vietic]], [[Katuic languages|Katuic]], [[Pearic languages|Pearic]], and [[Khmer language|Khmer]] were formed, while the more internally diverse [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] branch (dating to about 3,000 B.P.) underwent more extensive internal diversification.<ref name=\"Sidwell2015\"/> By the Iron Age, all of the Austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present-day locations, with most of the diversification within Austroasiatic taking place during the Iron Age.<ref name=\"Sidwell2015\"/>\n\nPaul Sidwell (2018)<ref>Sidwell, Paul. 2018. ''Austroasiatic deep chronology and the problem of cultural lexicon''. Paper presented at the 28th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society, held 17–19 May 2018 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.</ref> considers the Austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years B.P. during the arrival of rice agriculture in Indochina, but notes that the origin of Proto-Austroasiatic itself is older than that date. The lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum. The early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts, animal names, natural features, and pronouns, while the names of cultural items (agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts, which are reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic) form part of the later stratum.\n\n[[Roger Blench]] (2017)<ref name=\"Blench2017\">Blench, Roger. 2017. ''[http://southasiabibliography.de/uploads/Blench.pdf Waterworld: lexical evidence for aquatic subsistence strategies in Austroasiatic]''. Presented at ICAAL 7, Kiel, Germany.</ref> suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies (such as boats, waterways, river fauna, and fish capture techniques), can be reconstructed for Proto-Austroasiatic. Blench (2017) finds widespread Austroasiatic roots for 'river, valley', 'boat', 'fish', 'catfish sp.', 'eel', 'prawn', 'shrimp' (Central Austroasiatic), 'crab', 'tortoise', 'turtle', 'otter', 'crocodile', 'heron, fishing bird', and 'fish trap'. Archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern [[Indochina]] (northern Vietnam, Laos, and other nearby areas) dates back to only about 4,000 years B.P. (2,000 B.C.), with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the Yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6,000 B.P.<ref name=\"Blench2017\"/>\n\nHence, this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of Austroasiatic as compared to [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], whose speakers had a distinct non-riverine culture. In addition to living an aquatic-based lifestyle, early Austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock, crops, and newer types of watercraft. As early Austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways, they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area, such as Sino-Tibetan.<ref name=\"Blench2017\"/>\n\n","attributes":[{"name":"clade\n","values":[{"name":"label1","value":"Austroasiatic: {{nobreak|Mon–Khmer}}"},{"name":"1","value":"{{clade\n| 1=[[Munda languages|Munda]]\n| label2=&nbsp;Khasi–Palaungic&nbsp;\n| 2={{clade\n| 1=[[Khasic languages|Khasian]]\n| 2=[[Palaungic languages|Palaungic]]\n}}\n| 3=[[Khmuic languages|Khmuic]]\n| 4=[[Mangic languages|Mangic]]\n| 6=[[Vietic languages|Vietic]]\n| 7=[[Katuic languages|Katuic]]\n| 8=[[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]]\n| 9=[[Khmer language|Khmer]]\n| 10=[[Pearic languages|Pearic]]\n| 11=[[Monic languages|Monic]]\n| 12=[[Aslian languages|Aslian]]\n| 13=[[Nicobarese languages|Nicobarese]]\n| 14=?[[Shompen language|Shompen]]\n}}"}]},{"name":"nobreak","values":[{"name":"1","value":"Mon–Khmer"}]},{"name":"clade\n","values":[{"name":"1","value":"[[Munda languages|Munda]]"},{"name":"label2","value":"&nbsp;Khasi–Palaungic&nbsp;"},{"name":"2","value":"{{clade\n| 1=[[Khasic languages|Khasian]]\n| 2=[[Palaungic languages|Palaungic]]\n}}"},{"name":"3","value":"[[Khmuic languages|Khmuic]]"},{"name":"4","value":"[[Mangic languages|Mangic]]"},{"name":"6","value":"[[Vietic languages|Vietic]]"},{"name":"7","value":"[[Katuic languages|Katuic]]"},{"name":"8","value":"[[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]]"},{"name":"9","value":"[[Khmer language|Khmer]]"},{"name":"10","value":"[[Pearic languages|Pearic]]"},{"name":"11","value":"[[Monic languages|Monic]]"},{"name":"12","value":"[[Aslian languages|Aslian]]"},{"name":"13","value":"[[Nicobarese languages|Nicobarese]]"},{"name":"14","value":"?[[Shompen language|Shompen]]"}]},{"name":"clade\n","values":[{"name":"1","value":"[[Khasic languages|Khasian]]"},{"name":"2","value":"[[Palaungic languages|Palaungic]]"}]}],"id":8},{"title":" Possible extinct branches ","paragraphs":"[[Roger Blench]] (2009)<ref>Blench, Roger. 2009. \"[http://icaal.org/abstract/blench-are.html Are there four additional unrecognised branches of Austroasiatic?].\"</ref> also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of Austroasiatic that are now extinct, based on [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrate]] evidence in modern-day languages.\n* '''Pre-[[Chamic language|Chamic]] languages''' (the languages of coastal Vietnam prior to the Chamic migrations).

This situation is not unusual, even among long-established language families: scholars also frequently disagree on the internal classification of the [[Indo-European languages]], for instance.\n* The extinct [[Meroitic language]] has been proposed ([[Bruce Trigger]], 1964,<ref name=Trigger01>Trigger, Bruce G., ''‘Meroitic and Eastern Sudanic: A Linguistic Relationship?’'', Kush 12, 1964, 188–194.</ref> 1977<ref name=Trigger02>Trigger, Bruce, G.,''‘The Classification of Meroitic: Geographical Considerations’'', Schriften zur Geschichte und Kultur des Alten Orients 13, 1977, 421–435.</ref>) as an unclassified Afroasiatic language, because it shares the [[phonotactics]] characteristic of the family, but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification (Fritz Hintze, 1974,<ref name=Hintze01>Hintze, Fritz, ''‘Some Problems of Meroitic Philology’'', Abdel Gadir Mahmoud Abdalla (ed.),  Studies of the Ancient Languages of the Sudan, Sudanese Studies 3, Khartoum University Press, Khartoum, 1974, 73–78.</ref> 1979<ref name=Hintze02>Hintze, Fritz ''‘Beiträge zur meroitische Grammatik.’'' Meroitica 3, Berlin, 1979, 1–214.</ref>).\n* The classification of [[Kujargé language|Kujargé]] within Afroasiatic is not agreed upon.

This \"Hamitic language group\" was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient [[Egyptian language]], the [[Berber languages]], the [[Cushitic languages]], the [[Beja language]], and the [[Chadic languages]]. Unlike Müller, Lepsius considered that [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Nama language|Nama]] were part of the Hamitic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together.<ref name = \"mer\">[[Merritt Ruhlen]], ''A Guide to the World's Languages: Classification'', Stanford University Press, 1991, pp. 80–1</ref>\n[[File:Africa ethnic groups 1996.png|thumb|Distribution of the Afroasiatic/Hamito-Semitic languages in Africa]]\nIn 1912, [[Carl Meinhof]] published ''Die Sprachen der Hamiten'' (\"The Languages of the Hamites\"), in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Maasai language|Maasai]], [[Bari language|Bari]], [[Nandi languages|Nandi]], [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof's model was widely supported into the 1940s.<ref name = \"mer\"/> Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that \"speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'.\"<ref>Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'', CRC Press, 2005, p.797</ref> However, in the case of the so-called [[Nilo-Hamitic languages]] (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a \"fallacious theory of [[mixed language|language mixture]].\" Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub \"Nilo-Hamitic\" were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.<ref name=\"Ruhlen109\">Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages'', (Stanford University Press: 1991), p.109</ref>\n\n[[Leo Reinisch]] (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic. However, his suggestion found little acceptance. [[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct \"Hamitic\" subgroup, and included [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Finally, [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of \"Hamitic\" as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted Meinhof's linguistic theories, and rejected the use of racial and social evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate \"Nilo-Hamitic\" language category in particular, Greenberg was \"returning to a view widely held a half century earlier.\" He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings.<ref name=\"Ruhlen\"/> He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus.\n\nGreenberg's model was fully developed in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably [[Nilo-Saharan]]. Following [[Isaac Schapera]] and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the [[Hottentot language|Khoekhoe language]] as a member of the [[Khoisan languages]], a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of [[Click consonant|click sounds]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sands|first=Bonnie|date=2009|title=Africa's linguistic diversity|url=|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|volume=3|issue=2|pages=559–580|doi=10.1111/j.1749-818X.2008.00124.x}}</ref>. To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these languages consider them to be [[Language isolate|linguistic isolates]].<ref>Sands, Bonny E.

It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with languages from Afroasiatic's Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nThere are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following:\n* [[Hermann Möller]] (1906) argued for a relation between [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and the [[Indo-European languages]]. This proposal was accepted by a few linguists (e.g. [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]]). (For a fuller account, see [[Indo-Semitic languages]].) However, the theory has little currency today, although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families (such as [[grammatical gender]], noun-adjective [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], three-way [[Grammatical number|number]] distinction, and [[vowel alternation]] as a means of derivation).\n* Apparently influenced by Möller (a colleague of his at the [[University of Copenhagen]]), [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic macro-family]] (cf. Pedersen 1931:336–338), also included the Indo-European, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Yukaghir languages]], and [[Dravidian languages]]. This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]].\n* [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000–2002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], and to which he added [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotian]], [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japonic languages|Japanese-Ryukyuan]], [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]], and [[Ainu languages|Ainu]].\n* Most recently, [[Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin|Sergei Starostin]]'s school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic. The even larger [[Borean languages|Borean super-family]] contains Nostratic as well as [[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené-Caucasian]] and [[Austric languages|Austric]].\n\n","attributes":[],"id":6},{"title":"Date of Afroasiatic","paragraphs":"[[File:Assyriansample.ogg|thumb|right|180px|Speech sample in the Semitic [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Neo-Aramaic]] language, a descendant of [[Old Aramaic]]]]\nThe earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/9903/newsbriefs/egypt.html|title=Earliest Egyptian Glyphs – Archaeology Magazine Archive|author=|date=|website=www.archaeology.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> Symbols on [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzean]] (Naqada II) pottery resembling [[Egyptian hieroglyphs#History and evolution|Egyptian hieroglyphs]] date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating.

However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afroasiatic]] (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken [[circa|c.]] 10,000 BC.

This peculiarity makes the president of France, in his capacity as [[prince of Andorra]], an elected monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of heads of government of Andorra|head of government]] is the [[head of government|chief executive]], and of a [[wikt:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.\n\nThe current head of government is [[Xavier Espot Zamora]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.\n\nThe Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 councillors. The councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council.\n\nHalf are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the councillors are elected in a single national constituency. Fifteen days after the election, the councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the head of government is chosen from among the councillors.\n\n[[File:Casa de la Vall - 18.jpg|thumb|Casa de la Vall, the historical and ceremonial Andorran Parliament]]\n\nCandidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be head of government. The Syndic General then notifies the co-princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the head of government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.\n\n[[File:Casa de la Vall, Andorra la Vieja, Andorra, 2013-12-30, DD 03.JPG|thumb|left|The [[New Parliament of Andorra]], headquarters of the [[General Council of Andorra|General Council]] since 2011, next to [[Casa de la Vall]]]]\n\nThe Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it.\n\n[[File:Els 7 poetes, Casa de la Vall, Consell General.JPG|thumb|The centre of government in [[Andorra la Vella]]]]\n\nIf the head of government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the co-princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the councillors have the power to remove the head of government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the head of government is removed.\n\n","attributes":[{"name":"Main","values":[{"name":"1","value":"Politics of Andorra"}]},{"name":"Main","values":[{"name":"1","value":"Co-princes of Andorra"}]},{"name":"multiple image\n","values":[{"name":"align","value":"left"},{"name":"image1","value":"Mons.

This body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials (''veguers'') appointed by France and the Bishop of Urgell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policia.ad/historia.html|title=Cos de Policia - Història i identitat|website=Policia.ad|accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nDespite not being involved in any fighting during the First World War, Andorra was technically the longest combatant, as the country was left out of the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], [[de jure|technically]] remaining at war with Germany from its original declaration of war in 1914 until 24 September 1958 when Andorra officially declared peace with Germany.<ref name=\"DYKAndorra\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Reich |first=Herb |date=2012 |title=Lies They Teach in School: Exposing the Myths Behind 250 Commonly Believed Fallacies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsI_ub0Vh7EC |location=New York |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|page=52 |isbn=9781620873458}}</ref>\n\nIn the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties.
